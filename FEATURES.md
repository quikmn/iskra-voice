## Architecture

- **Server**: C# WebSocket server (`iskra_server/Program.cs`), port 8080 by default
- **Client wrapper**: C# WPF/WebView2 app (`iskra_client/Program.cs`) — bridge between OS and JS
- **Frontend**: Single-file vanilla JS/HTML/CSS (`iskra_client/index.html`)
- **World model**: `servers/<name>/` folder per instance — `server.json`, `chat-{chId}.jsonl`, `dms/`, `fingerprints.json`, `bans.json`, `audit.jsonl`, `uploads/`
- **Iskra Relay**: ASP.NET Core minimal API (`iskra_relay/`) — deployed at `https://id.iskra.foo` on DigitalOcean AMS3; SQLite, Resend email, bcrypt passwords, hex session tokens
